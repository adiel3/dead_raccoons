# How close has your child been to a dead raccoon?
### The parents of New York City need to know

A spatial analysis exploration of the proximity of reported dead raccoons to elementary schools in New York City.

For the second project for Lede 2024, I used python and pandas to analyze New York City's 311 data about dead raccoons, then used QGIS to conduct map and conduct spatial analysis on the data in relation to other public city data for borough boundaries, parks, neighbhorhood tabulation areas, subway lines and stations, and public elementary school locations. Tools used for this project include Python, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator and ai2html.
